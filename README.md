## Welcome to Tunneller

This is the first proper game I attempted to make as an adult. As a child I played around on Flash MX and started to miss it many years later so I began to watch Coding Train videos and derived inspiration from the [Snake-game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaGK-fj-BAM) video.

I have learned a lot since this project so please check out this [space-shooter](https://astro-david.herokuapp.com/) I wrote in pretty much vanilla JavaScript (used jQuery and hammer.js for things predominantly unrelated to the actual gameplay) and the mini projects I have been working on at [Codepen](https://codepen.io/crossjames934).
